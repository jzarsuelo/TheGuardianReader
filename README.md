# The Guardian Reader

## Description
The app shows a list of news from [The Guardian API](http://open-platform.theguardian.com/)

## Purpose
The application is created to meet the final project of **Udacity's Android Basic: Networking**. This serves as a refresher for my Android Basic Networking skill.

## Requirement
To run the app properly, you need an **API KEY** from [The Guardian Open Platform](http://open-platform.theguardian.com/access/) or you can use `test` in [res/values/api_keys.xml](https://github.com/jzarsuelo/TheGuardianReader/blob/master/app/src/main/res/values/api_keys.xml)

`<string name="the_guardian_api_key">*** PLACE YOUR (THE GUARDIAN) API KEY ***</string>`
